# marketing-agency

In this project, I refactored the starter code in an effort to improve accessibility on the page. I completed the following:

1. Updated the HTML file to replace div elements with semantic HTML elements.
2. Updated the HTML and CSS files to both have a logical structure between elements and classes. In the starter code, there were both unneccessary and duplicate classes and ids that I was able to condense and/or remove to clean up the code.
3. Added accessible alt attributes to all images on the page.
4. Ensured all heading attributes fell in sequential order.
5. Updated the title element to a descriptive title of the site.
